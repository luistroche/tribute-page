	<p>Jose Francisco de San Martin and Matorras was born in Yapeyu, Corrientes Argentina, on February 25th, 1778.
José de San Martín was the fifth and last son of Juan de San Martín, a Spanish military personnel, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser.
The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1781, when San Martín was  four years old.
Juan requested to be transferred to Spain, leaving the Americas in 1783. The family settled in Madrid, but as Juan was not allowed a promotion because he was not a noble, they moved to Málaga to pursue an administrative position in the military. 
Once in the city, San Martín enrolled in Málaga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785. Then he enrolled in the Regiment of Murcia in 1789, when he reached the required age of 11. He began his military career as a cadet in the Murcian Infantry Unit.
San Martín took part in several Spanish campaigns in Africa, fighting in Melilla and in Oran against the Moors in 1791, among others. His rank was raised to Sub-Lieutenant in 1793, at the age of 15. He began a naval career during the War of the Second Coalition, when Spain was allied with France against Great Britain, during the time of the French Revolution. His ship "Santa Dorotea" was captured by British forces, who kept him prisoner for some time. Soon afterward, he continued to fight in southern Spain, mainly in Cadiz and Gibraltar with the rank of Second Captain of light infantry. He continued to fight Portugal on the side of Spain in the War of the Oranges in 1801. He was promoted to captain in 1804. During his stay in Cádiz he was influenced by the ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment.
At the outbreak of the Peninsular War in 1808, San Martín was named adjutant and was appointed to the armies of Andalucía, and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a guerrilla force led by Juan de la Cruz Mourgeon. He was nearly killed during the battle of Arjonilla, but was saved by Sergeant Juan de Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the battle of Bailén, a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Martín was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the battle of Albuera under the command of general William Carr Beresford. By this time, the French armies held most of the Iberian Peninsula under their control, except for Cádiz.
In 1811 San Martín asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Argentina.
