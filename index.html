	<h3 id="early-life">Early Life</h3>
	<p>Jose Francisco de San Martin and Matorras was born in Yapeyu, Corrientes Argentina, on February 25th, 1778.
	José de San Martín was the fifth and last son of Juan de San Martín, a Spanish military personnel, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser.
	The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1781, when San Martín was  four years old.
	Juan requested to be transferred to Spain, leaving the Americas in 1783. The family settled in Madrid, but as Juan was not allowed a promotion because he was not a noble, they moved to Málaga to pursue an administrative position in the military. 
	Once in the city, San Martín enrolled in Málaga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785. Then he enrolled in the Regiment of Murcia in 1789, when he reached the required age of 11. He began his military career as a cadet in the Murcian Infantry Unit.
	San Martín took part in several Spanish campaigns in Africa, fighting in Melilla and in Oran against the Moors in 1791, among others. His rank was raised to Sub-Lieutenant in 1793, at the age of 15. He began a naval career during the War of the Second Coalition, when Spain was allied with France against Great Britain, during the time of the French Revolution. His ship "Santa Dorotea" was captured by British forces, who kept him prisoner for some time. Soon afterward, he continued to fight in southern Spain, mainly in Cadiz and Gibraltar with the rank of Second Captain of light infantry. He continued to fight Portugal on the side of Spain in the War of the Oranges in 1801. He was promoted to captain in 1804. During his stay in Cádiz he was influenced by the ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment.
	At the outbreak of the Peninsular War in 1808, San Martín was named adjutant and was appointed to the armies of Andalucía, and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a guerrilla force led by Juan de la Cruz Mourgeon. He was nearly killed during the battle of Arjonilla, but was saved by Sergeant Juan de Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the battle of Bailén, a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Martín was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the battle of Albuera under the command of general William Carr Beresford. By this time, the French armies held most of the Iberian Peninsula under their control, except for Cádiz.
	In 1811 San Martín asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Argentina.

	<h2 class="text-center">Freedom Campaign</h2>
	<h3>Argentina</h3>
	<p>In March 9th, 1812 San Martin arrived in the frigate George Canning to Buenos Aires port.
		A few days after, He was appointed as the Lieutenant Colonel of the cavalry force unit. As Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry, he began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers. Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.
		At the same period, San Martin was one of the responsible on the creation of a local branch of the Lodge of Rational Knights.
		On September 12, 1812, in a private ceremony at the Buenos Aires cathedral Jose de San Martin married Maria de los Remedios de Escalada y La Quintana.
		 
		In October because of a revolution organized and promoted by the Lodge of Rational Knights, and in  the need for institutional reorganization, San Martin got promoted to Colonel.

	</p>
	<h4>Campaign of San Lorenzo.</h4>
	<p>
		San Martin intelligence agents detected the enemies forces rounding the cost of Montevideo, on the other shore of the Rio de la Plata. He immediately formed an expedition force which included the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and Infantry columns.
		The Regiment followed the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They hid in the San Carlos Convent, in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe. San Martín watched the enemy ships from the top of the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Martín employed a pincer movement to trap the royalists. He led one column and Justo Bermúdez the other.
		San Martín's horse was killed during the battle, and his leg was trapped under the corpse of the animal after the fall. A royalist, attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face, and a bullet wound to his arm. Juan Bautista Cabral intervened and saved his life; Cabral was mortally wounded, and died shortly afterwards as a hero.

	</p>
	<h4> Army of the North.</h4>
	<p>
		In October, 1813 , the Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing General Manuel Belgrano.
		The army was in poor condition. San Martín stayed only a few weeks in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain.
		San Martín had health problems in April 1814. He temporarily delegated the command of the Army to colonel Francisco Fernández de la Cruz and requested leave to recover.
		He moved to Santiago del Estero, and then to Córdoba where he slowly recovered.
		San Martín came up with a plan: organize an army in Mendoza, cross the Andes to Chile, and move to Peru by sea; all while Güemes defended the north frontier. This would place him in Peru without crossing the harsh terrain of Upper Peru, where two campaigns had already been defeated.
		To advance this plan, he requested the governorship of the Cuyo province, which was accepted. He took office on 6 September.
		
	</p>
	<h4> Governor de Cuyo</h4>
	<p>
		San Martín began immediately to organize the Army of the Andes, in the Cuyo region with the capital in Mendoza. He drafted all the citizens who could bear arms and all the slaves from ages 16 to 30, requested reinforcements to Buenos Aires, and reorganized the economy for war production.
		The government of San Martín was a combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers.
		The army was not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh conditions on the mountains, the crossing could only be done in the summer season, when there is less snow.
		San Martín proposed that the country needed to be independent from Spain  immediately, before the crossing. That way, they would be acting as a sovereign nation, and not as a mere rebellion. He had great influence over the Congress of Tucumán, a Congress with deputies from the provinces, which was established in March 1816.The Congress of Tucumán declared  Argentina’s independence on 9 July 1816.
		Another important aspect in San Martin’s life happened on August, 24th 1816 , when his Daughter Mercedes Tomasa San Martin y Escalada was born.
		Needing even more soldiers, San Martín extended the emancipation of slaves to the ages from 14 to 55, and even allowed them to be promoted to higher military ranks.
		He included as well the Chileans who escaped Chile after the disaster of Rancagua, and organized them in four units, each one of infantry, cavalry, artillery and dragoons. At the end of 1816, the Army of the Andes had 5,000 men, 10,000 mules and 1,500 horses. San Martin organized military intelligence, propaganda and disinformation to confuse the royalist armies, boost the national fervor of his army and promote desertion among the royalists.

	</p>
	<h4> Crossing the Andes Mountains</h4>

	<p>
		On the morning of January 19, 1817, San Martin and his army set out from their base camp El Plumerillo and began their journey across the Andes Mountain range. San Martin crossed with 5,000 men, only to end up losing 1/3 of them. It was a devastating blow to the troop. The number of auxiliaries reached 1,200.
		For the crossing, San Martin split his army into two divisions: The main division, which traveled through the pass of Los Patos, was led by San Martin, Miguel Estanislao Soler and Bernardo O’Higgins. The secondary troop, which traveled through the more southern Uspallata, was led by Juan Gregorio de Las Heras.
		The whole operation took nearly a month. The armies took dried food for the soldiers and fodder for the horses, because of the inhospitable conditions. They also consumed garlics and onions, to prevent altitude sickness. Only 4,300 mules and 511 horses survived, less than half the original complement.
		On February 13, 1817, San Martín, O’Higgins, and their army successfully entered Santiago, Chile, after crossing 500 kilometers of mountain range, and the journey came to an end. The royalist forces, by this time, had advanced north to avoid San Martín's army, but a royalist leader had stayed behind with 1,500 men to advance at a valley called Chacabuco, which was located near Santiago. Thus, the Battle of Chacabuco began.


	</p>
	<h3>Chile</h3>
	<h4>Battle of Chacabuco.</h4>
	<p>
		The columns that crossed the Andes began to take military actions. The column in the north led by Cabot defeated the royalists in Salala, seized Coquimbo and then Copiapó.The forces in the south,  captured Talca and routed royalist outposts in Juncalito and Potrerillos.
		Bernardo O'Higgins, who came from Los Patos pass, defeated the royalists at Las Coimas
		The Main columns gather at Aconcagua Valley, meeting at the slopes of Chacabuco.
		The Enemy's army had 2400 soldiers and 5 pieces of artillery. San Martin had 3600 men and 9 pieces of artillery.
		The battle began on 12 February. San Martín organized a pincer movement, with Soler leading the west column and O'Higgins the east one. O'Higgins, eager to avenge the defeat at Rancagua, rushed to the attack, instead of coordinating with Soler. This gave the royalists a brief advantage. San Martín instructed Soler to rush the attack as well. The combined attack was successful and San Martín's column secured the final victory. The battle ended with 600 royalists dead and 500 prisoners, with only 12 deaths and 120 injuries in the Army of the Andes
		The army triumphantly entered Santiago de Chile the following day. Governor Francisco Marcó del Pont attempted to escape to Valparaíso and sail to Peru, but he was captured on 22 February and returned to Santiago. Several other officials were captured as well and sent as prisoners to San Luis, Argentina. San Martín sent Marcó del Pont prisoner to Mendoza.
	</p>

	<h4> The New Homeland.</h4>
	<p>
		Three deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepción organized a new government, and proposed San Martín as Supreme Director of Chile. He declined the offer and proposed O'Higgins in his stead: he recommended that the Supreme Director should be someone from Chile. San Martín would instead organize the navy to take the fight to Peru.
		he victory in Chacabuco did not liberate all Chile. Royalist forces still resisted in southern Chile, allied with the mapuches.
		San Martín left O'Higgins in charge of the Army, and returned to Buenos Aires to request resources for the campaign to Peru. He did not have a good reception this time.
		He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.
		 
		The viceroy of Peru sent naval reinforcements from the North in an attempt to reconquer Chile.
		an Martín thought that it was not possible to defend Concepción, so he ordered O'Higgins to leave the city. 50,000 Chileans took cattle and grain and moved north.
		As he had done with the Tucumán Congress, San Martín urged a declaration of independence, to legitimize the government and the military actions. The Chilean Declaration of Independence was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.
		San Martín, formed an army of 7000 men with Las Heras and Balcarce in Curico, and the royalists in Cancha Rayada.
		A spy informed San Martín that the royalist would make a surprise attack in the night, but the army could not be prepared in time. 1,000 soldiers fled, 120 died, and San Martín's assistant was killed. O'Higgins tried to resist with his unit, but retired when he was shot in the arm. Las Heras managed to retire his army in order, saving his 3,500 men. The patriots escaped to Santiago.
		Despite the defeat, the soldiers were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback.
		The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.

	</p>
	<h4>The Battle of Maipu.</h4>
	<p>
		San Martín made a brief reconnaissance of the royalist army, and noticed several flaws in their organization. Feeling secure of victory, he claimed that "Osorio is clumsier than I thought. Today's triumph is ours. The sun as witness!".
		The battle began at 11:00 am. The patriot artillery on the right fired on the royalist infantry on the left. Manuel Escalada led mounted grenadiers to capture the royalist artillery, turning them against their owners.
		The firing suddenly ended and royalists began to fight with sword bayonets, under the cries "Long live the king!" and "Long live the homeland!" respectively. Finally, the royalists ended their cries and began to disperse. 
		The battle ended in the afternoon. O'Higgins, still injured by the wound received in Cancha Rayada, arrived during the final action. He claimed "Glory to the savior of Chile!", in reference to San Martín, who praised him for going to the battlefield with his unhealed wound. They made an embrace on their horses, now known as the "Embrace of Maipú".
		The battle of Maipú secured Chilean independence.

	</p>
	<h3>Peru</h3>
	<h4>Preparations and expedition.</h4>
	<p>
		Peru royalist  armed forces were nearly four times the strength of those of San Martín: nearly 23,000 soldiers in total. The Army of the Andes had 4,000 soldiers instead, and Cochrane's navy another 1,600. With this disparity of forces, San Martín tried to avoid battles. He tried instead to divide the enemy forces in several locations, as he did during the Crossing of the Andes, and trap the royalists with a pincer movement with either reinforcements of the Army of the North from the South or the army of Simón Bolívar from the North.
		He also tried to promote rebellions and insurrection within the royalist ranks, and promised the emancipation of any slaves that deserted their Peruvian masters and join the army of San Martín. 
		The navy sailed from Chile on 20 August 1820. It was composed of eight warships, eleven gunboats, 247 cannons and a crew of 1,600, most of them Chileans. There were 12 frigates, and a brig with the 4,000 soldiers of the Army of the Andes. San Martín was the leader of the military expedition. They landed in Paracas, 200 km to the south of Lima, on 7 September, and occupied the nearby city of Pisco, which was abandoned by the royalists
	</p>

	<h4>Protector of Peru.</h4>
	<p>
		After many small guerrilla battles and frustrated negotiations with the royalist many soldiers and natives from the spanish militia deserted and joined San Martin revolution.
		As hostilities renewed, San Martín organized several guerrilla groups in the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as he did not want to appear as a conqueror to the local population. However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Martín called for an open cabildo to discuss the independence of the country, which was agreed. With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Martín declared the independence of Peru on 28 July 1821. The war, however, had not ended yet.
		Unlike Chile, Peru had no local politicians of the stature of O'Higgins, so San Martín became the leader of the government, even though he did not want to. He was appointed Protector of Peru.
		But San Martin was in need of reinforcement to provide protection to Lima and the North region.
		San Martín thought that if he joined forces with Bolívar he would be able to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru.

	</p>

	<h4>San Martin and Simon Bolivar.</h4>
	<p>
		The Guayaquil conference took place on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the following one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, the content of their discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion may have been a request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Martín ranked second to Bolívar.
		The authority of San Martín and Bolívar, and the local rivalry of their respective countries Peru and Colombia, limited their options for joint work: Colombians would not have liked Bolívar to give many of his forces to San Martín, whilst Peruvians would not have liked their Protector to be second in command to Bolívar, and a joint command would complicate the maintenance of military discipline. Unlike Bolívar, backed up by the Colombian government, San Martín did not have more resources than those he already had: Buenos Aires denied him any support.

	</p>
	<h4>Resign as protector of Peru.</h4>
	<p>
		Several reasons influenced him to resign. The governor of Peru was removed by a rebellion, during San Martin absence.The peruvian support was very weak, O'Higgins was about to be deposed in Chile, and Cochrane took the navy and left him without naval power. San Martín resigned as Protector of Peru a few days later and returned to Valparaíso, Chile. 
		After those situations He decided to go back to Valparaiso, Chile and later to Argentina.
